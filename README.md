# DMCA-Free-Stuff
## DMCA Free Music / tunes / sound effects for usage on streaming / recorded content / project development. (DMCA-Free as in provides the necessary licenses to battle any DMCA claim and should be safe from receiving any DMCA claims.) Some are paid options and some are available for free. Though, if you do happen to use the free resources and think they are worth a reward, please do give the creator a reward! Thank you very much and I hope you enjoy this list.

### If you know of music that is not listed here that is available with terms/licensing that is documented upfront and is available for use (better if including for commercial use), then please open up an Issue with a link to the information (Main page/Download page and also terms/license page if possible). I will try to keep this updated.

'You may use Abstraction music in any media
This encompasses pretty much anything including streaming, YouTube, game development, podcasts, and film. But please, contact me through Twitter before you do; I want to know how you use the music so I can share your stuff! '

'If you are using a song, it is required to properly attribute it in your project's credits. When attributing music, list the song's title and give credit by name (Abstraction). Also, you must include a link to either the Bandcamp page (http://abstractionmusic.bandcamp.com/) or home page (http://www.abstractionmusic.com/).

I understand that much of this will rely on the honor system since I cannot monitor the entire Internet, but please keep in mind that everyone works hard at their craft and recognition like this helps more than you think.'
